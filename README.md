# GeneMates: an R package performing association analysis for bacterial allelic presence-absence data and inferring horizontal gene co-transfer

This is an ongoing project looking for horizontal gene co-transfer (HGcoT) between bacteria of the same species using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This repository provides an R package called GeneMates to perform the main analysis.

Since this project is in active development and a paper is under preparation, the package and supplementary tools should be used with caution. Please cite this repository if you use our tool:

This project is supported by the University of Melbourne.

**Progress**

* This package is to be completed by the end of August, 2018.
* Documentation for this package will be gradually finished afterwards.
* Please contact me if you are really keen to use this package for your research before its completion.
